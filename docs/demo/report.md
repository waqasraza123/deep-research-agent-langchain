# Summary of Deep Agents

- Deep Agents are autonomous AI agents designed to handle complex tasks by breaking them down into smaller subtasks.
- They maintain context and state across multiple steps, enabling long-term task management.
- Deep Agents support spawning subagents to perform parallel task execution and multi-agent collaboration.
- They enhance efficiency and scalability in AI workflows.
- Useful for applications requiring planning, iterative refinement, and long-term memory.
- Implemented within LangChain to facilitate advanced AI agent development.

**Conclusion:** Deep Agents provide a powerful framework for building scalable, autonomous AI systems capable of complex, multi-step problem solving [S1].
