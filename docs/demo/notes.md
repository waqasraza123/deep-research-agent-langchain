# Notes on Deep Agents [S1]

- Deep Agents are a concept in LangChain for building autonomous AI agents.
- They enable agents to perform complex tasks by decomposing them into smaller, manageable subtasks.
- Deep Agents can manage their own context and state across multiple steps.
- They support multi-agent collaboration and can spawn subagents for parallel task execution.
- Designed to improve efficiency and scalability of AI workflows.
- Useful for tasks requiring long-term memory, planning, and iterative refinement.
